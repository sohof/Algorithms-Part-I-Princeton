This was a pogramming assignment course algorithms part one.
The main purpose was to practice and implement the union-find data structure.


The algs4.jar file needs to be included in the classpath.

Run by invoking: java PercolationStat N X


The class PercolationStat receives a grid size N and X nr of experiments from command line
and does Monte Carlo simulation To estimate the percolation threshold. Depends on class Percolation.java and some other classes in algs4.jar
