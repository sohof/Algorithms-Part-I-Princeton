This was a pogramming assignment course algorithms part one.
The goal was to write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. To implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators. More information is available in the pdf documents.


The algs4.jar file needs to be included in the classpath.

Run by invoking: echo AA BB BB BB BB BB CC CC | java Subset 8 BB AA BB

The Subset client takes a command­line integer k; reads in a sequence of N strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints out exactly k of them, uniformly at random. Each item from the sequence can be printed out at most once. You may assume that 0 ≤ k ≤ N, where N is the number of string on standard input.
