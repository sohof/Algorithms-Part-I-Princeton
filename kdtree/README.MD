This was a pogramming assignment course algorithms part one.

The goal was to write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x­ and y­coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d­tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). 2d­trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.


The algs4.jar file needs to be included in the classpath.

You may use the following interactive client programs to test and debug your code.
KdTreeVisualizer.java computes and draws the 2d­tree that results from the sequence of points clicked by the user in the standard drawing window.


NearestNeighborVisualizer.java reads a sequence of points from a file (specified as a command­line argument) and inserts those points into a 2d­tree. Then, it performs nearest neighbor queries on the point corresponding to the location of the mouse in the standard drawing window.
